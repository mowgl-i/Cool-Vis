Else.heartbreak() is a facinating gaming filled fun coding puzzles and juicy narratives. I would like to say that this is the gamename that encouraged me to learn more about code. 

In this project, I hope to generate alot of cool plots for this gamename. 

My first plot will be about downloads/active players YTD for the gamename.
